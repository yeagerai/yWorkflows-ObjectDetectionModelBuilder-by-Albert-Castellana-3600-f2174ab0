# ObjectDetectionModelBuilder

This Yeager Workflow enables the user to build and deploy an object detection model by: 1. Uploading labeled images in a specific format (e.g., COCO, PASCAL VOC). 2. Preprocessing the uploaded images to meet the input requirements of the object detection model (e.g., resizing, normalization). Supporting different formats like png, jpeg. 3. Training an object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD, or Faster R-CNN) using the preprocessed images and labels. 4. Exporting the trained model in a specific format suitable for deployment (e.g., ONNX, TensorFlow). 5. Deploying the exported model on a cloud-based platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, containerized application) for real-time object detection using REST API.

## Initial generation prompt
