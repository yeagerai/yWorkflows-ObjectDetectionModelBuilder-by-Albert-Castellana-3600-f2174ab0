# Component Name

ModelTrainer

## Description

The ModelTrainer component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow designed to train object detection models using provided preprocessed images and converted labels. The trained model can be saved in the desired format such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Input and Output Models

### Input Models

1. **ModelTrainerInput**
   - `preprocessed_images`: List of PreprocessedImage objects (image: bytes)
   - `converted_labels`: List of ConvertedLabel objects (label: str)
   - `model_type`: The type of object detection model to train (str)
   - `epochs`: The number of training epochs (int)
   - `learning_rate`: The learning rate for training (float)

### Output Models

1. **ModelTrainerOutput**
   - `trained_model`: A trained Model object (content: bytes, model_type: str)

All input and output data types use Pydantic BaseModel for validation and serialization.

## Parameters

The ModelTrainer component does not have any specific parameters besides the ones specified in its input model, ModelTrainerInput.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the ModelTrainer component takes the input `args: ModelTrainerInput` and returns a `ModelTrainerOutput` object. The method can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Initialize the selected object detection model based on the `model_type` parameter.
2. Prepare the training dataset with preprocessed_images and converted_labels.
3. Set the model training parameters, including epochs and the learning rate.
4. Train the model using the prepared dataset and training parameters.
5. Save the trained model in the desired format (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
6. Return the ModelTrainerOutput object containing the trained model's binary data and model type.

## External Dependencies

The ModelTrainer component has the following external dependencies:

- `os`
- `FastAPI`: Used to create the API for the ModelTrainer component.
- `pydantic`: Used for defining and validating the input and output models.

## API Calls

The ModelTrainer component does not make any external API calls.

## Error Handling

The ModelTrainer component does not have any specific error handling mechanisms. Errors related to input validation and serialization are handled by Pydantic. It is encouraged to implement error handling for specific model training steps, such as handling errors related to incorrect model types or issues during training.

## Examples

To use the ModelTrainer component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Create ModelTrainerInput with preprocessed_images, converted_labels, model_type, epochs, and learning_rate.
2. Initialize a ModelTrainer object.
3. Call the `transform()` method with the input ModelTrainerInput, and obtain the ModelTrainerOutput.
4. Use the trained_model from the ModelTrainerOutput in other components of the Yeager Workflow that require a trained object detection model.
